```json
{"input":
    {
        "mock_return": "Anything here will be returned as the output of the worker.",
        "mock_delay": 0, // The number of seconds to wait before returning output, raising error or crashing.
        "mock_error": false, // If true, the worker will raise an error.
        "mock_crash": false // If true, the worker will crash (kills the processes)
    }
}
```
